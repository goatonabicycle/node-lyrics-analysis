# node-lyrics-analysis

Trying to find silly meaning in a mountain of words

## What is this even?

The idea here is to do some simple lyrics analysis.
For example:

- How many times has Aesop Rock used the word "banana"?
- How has the relationship of the word "the" changed over albums?
- Who swears the most between artist X and artist Y?

and other interesting things like that...

This isn't hosted anywhere yet.

## Getting it to run:

```
 npm install
 run the `dev` and `ui` scripts from `package.json`.
```

## How do I run tests?

```
npm test
```

## Notes and ideas

Random ideas.

- Number of albums
- Unique words per album
- Deal with [Hook x2] and [Verse One]
- Number of unique words total
- Graph of top 20 most used words.
- Most used word! (That isn't "a", "the", "and")

## TODO

- Get the artist id based off of their name.
- Get all the songs for the artist.
- Using those song ids, get all the song info.
- Using that song info, get all the unique albums.
- Store the song and album information as indexes per artist.
- Per song, per Album, get the lyrics and the analisys of that song.

Other things:

- Pipeline.
- A nice readme.
- An aesthetic. A name.
