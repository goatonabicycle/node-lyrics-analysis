# node-lyrics-analysis

Trying to find silly meaning in a mountain of words

## What is this even?

The idea here is to do some simple lyrics analysis.
For example:

- How many times has Aesop Rock used the word "banana"?
- How has the relationship of the word "the" changed over albums?
- Who swears the most between artist X and artist Y?

and other interesting things like that...

This isn't hosted anywhere yet.

## Getting it to run:

```
 npm install
 run the `dev` and `ui` scripts from `package.json` (ideally from vscode's "npm Scripts" window)
```

## Notes and ideas

Random ideas.

- Number of albums
- Unique words per album
- Deal with [Hook x2] and [Verse One]
- Number of unique words total
- Graph of top 20 most used words.
- Most used word! (That isn't "a", "the", "and")
