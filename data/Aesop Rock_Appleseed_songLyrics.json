(Yeah)\nGood morning my sweet vision of morbid disorder\nAnd good evening wonderful riddance and such\nMaybe today I'll touch the burgundy halo\nTrimming the tunnels end off end with tenants spangled 'cross\nA more tangible premise\nThis splendors, shimmy splinters all up in day-tripper visuals\nTake it easy man, fuck it I'll take it any way I can\nMy palms are chinrests\nWhen I witness fury scurry past my window\nModel city in a bottle plugged hostile\nIts bliss kissin pollution\nAnd a billion suckers pucker in a bind\nMaybe the sunken ship is the treasure\nNo, but they insist it man, I'm\nI'm trying to spin me dizzy, sponging up to giving dungeons functions\nAs opposed to art historians absorbed inside assumptions\nEverybody drop your knuckles when the style divorces vertical\nMarveling at the spite with which it curdled\nOutside my tenement: coax a little warmth\nFrom out the mugs of masons wasted\nLaying bricks for days to later find they own the lot adjacent\nMark the blasphemy, elements of eloquence and savagery\nMurder the gossip, fuck it, run off happily\nThe broken spoke cyclers choking open Doctor Zaius born fetus\nIn a matchbox keylessly padlocked to the hammer base\nNow these impurities embedded in five illiterates textiles\nShedded in the hell tale to motivate behind suspended leverage\nNow I'm drowning in a pool of why are you here\nSever ties with my beast of burden pertinent to if I die this year\n\nMy name is Dryspell\nMy name is pillar\nMy name's allegiance\nMy name is flagrant\nMy name's a thousand steps from patience\nBut I'm sick and tired of waiting\nMy name's Polaris\nMy name is canvas\nMy name is lowlife\nMy name's intention\nMy name is every imperfection that plays a part in my descension\nMy name is

past\"\n\nCircle of sandbags dragged to shield the meal the needy hand grabs\nI'm splitting hopes at your local Acropolis\nOpulence in a cockpit not the pocket for them born with a pebble toss\nSunk to rest while they've exhausted the art of drunken address\nExhibit fracture lines that converge towards where the hackers whine\nWhen trappers slack, the traps unlatch, the catch covers the tracking lines\nThat will make his majesty furious\nOh bury his head and how could I have been so dense\nIf only, yeah but I'm lonely\nMy days graze normalcy then morbidly crash\nMy years breathe honesty then sardonically laugh\nAlas, I dig my toes in to the sand and spit foliage out my lips Personifying mankind's end all aspirations\nHope floats...\nNo, hope sinks like broken boats and most harassed before provoked\nI'm tossing darts at a map of the arts to pick up where you choked\nAnd when the last leaf falls off the branches of resonance\nI'll be waiting with my butterfly net to collect the evidence\nWell I am a room with poison oak scaling the sides\nArachnids on the celing, rugged thumb tacks, bones and rusty pipes\nIf you can squeeze between the bars (then please!)\nEnjoy my space employ my waste\nEncase the hand dealt by a stolen grace\nDo you ever wish the circle was a square\nSo when landsharks start circling the borders\nYou could just cut them off at the corners?\nThere's a ghost in the basket of values\nPertinent to, which cayak pilot succeeded in surfin' it through\nNow I'm surfin it through\nSo if you need me spread your wings to spell my name\nAbove the mess near the other funny requests\nSee my all too tolerant mannerisms have hired a whim\nTo assist in a meticulous pick a part of cobweb skins\nOf innocence\nA child of timid instinct with that ten step ahead premise\nSupply dust bowls before the zephyr was requested\nA mile in humble shoes, ten shades of blues come off the difference\nI grimace, took me one hour's blink to conclude there simply isn't\n\nMy name is Dryspell\nMy name is pillar\nMy name's allegiance\nMy name is flagrant\nMy name's a thousand steps from patience\nBut I'm sick and tired of waitin\nMy name's Polaris\nMy name is
